                    <p>Heredity pertains to the formation of your DNA from your parents when you were conceived. It is quite literally the program of the way you will grow throughout time and the innate physical characteristics you will develop. Maturation are the changes that you experience based on the completion of genetic growth. Environment is the immediate surrounding that affect or change your bodily processes, it can encompass all matter around you.</p>

Divided into three categories of culture, socio-digital, and economic/material perspectives, the social self is formed from the social means and systems humans have built. Studying one’s image from a social point of view can help in figuring out what our place is within the community.</p> <br>
                    <p>Most humans in society are a member of vital and nested social groups that act as a domain to develop values and beliefs that is core to the cultural self. The advent of the internet or digital space paved way for everyone to establish a presence in an online platform. Our digital selves are then disembodied from physical contact and communication turned purely verbal if not most of it. Lastly, material possessions or economic objects represent a lot of who we are in terms of personality and preferences as well as necessities. </p> <br>

                    <p>One of the greatest ability of humans and long-standing mysteries is our degree of intelligence. The mental self is tied with our consciousness and complex brain functions but we barely know anything about the former and put a lot of focus on cognition and learning. There is cognition, memory and intelligence that drive the mechanism of the learning process. </p> <br>
                    <p>Cognition refers to the ability to sense, acquire, and understand information. Memory serves as the faculty where information is stored and accessed in future actions. Intelligence is the skill to collect and apply the knowledge that one possesses and is considered a skill. All these three facilitates the process known as learning which is discussed as a relatively permanent change in a person’s knowledge or behavior as a result of experience”. The management and understanding of these parts create the image of the mental self.</p>

The system of emotional responsiveness to our experiences is made possible by biological processes and act as one of our survival mechanisms. These emotional experiences are driven by underlying situations and understanding it takes emotional intelligence and regulation. Being able to apply strategies to control and accurately express feelings form the emotional self.</p> <br>
                    <p>Emotional Intelligence is our capacity to process our own emotions and those of others, and efficiently apply them to decisions we make that usually have significant impact to overall condition in life. Emotional regulation on the other hand focuses on how one can effectively manage emotions particularly when it becomes too intense and seemingly unpredictable. Uncontrolled emotions can lead to destructive results in all aspects of one’s life and can cause severely unhealthy behavior and long-term illness.</p>

                    <p>I’m often enamored when I see someone one can regard as ‘expressing their soul’ through a specific action. It could be shown through a performance, invention, or just the depth of their understanding of the world and the fact that it can be felt by others is fascinating. The spiritual self is quite distinct to a religious person in the idea that it focuses on one’s meaning and purpose in life rather than faith in a deity. The lectures also highlighted three aspects of the spiritual self namely the inner soul, connections with nature, and discovering life’s meaning.</p> <br>
                    <p>The idea of the soul largely describes a person’s spirituality and connection to the experience of the divine and transcendent. The form it takes can vary differently from person to person and is a core influence to our values, views, and actions. Connection with nature refers to our communal relationship with nature which suggests plays an important part in human well-being. Lastly,  the meaning of one’s life is the abstraction of life philosophy from an assessment of our memories, choices and consequences, and reality as we experience it. Being able to establish a clear and complete spiritual self can somehow bring a much more positive effect to one’s experiences.</p> <br>

                    <p>I often do introspective activities, but writing it down for someone to read made me realize how difficult it is to express my reflections in life and perspective. It was enlightening to know I still have a long way ahead of my ‘spiritual journey’.</p>
